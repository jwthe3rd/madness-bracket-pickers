# madness-bracket-pickers
Old Project from Spring 2021, testing Support Vector Machines and Logistic Regression against random selection training on data from sports-reference.com

Limitations of this approach includes
-> Data from only past ten years, and included regular season data
-> Only included data on teams from the Power 5 Conferences
-> Only included average team stats for the year, could very well have been improved by either
  ->including invididual player stats for players who were active
  -> Using some kind of moving average of a team for the preceding n games
-> Support Vector Machines and Logistic Regression are powerful techniques, but further ML techniques and even Deep Learning techniques could be explored.
